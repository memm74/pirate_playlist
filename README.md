# Pirate Playlist

A playlist for my [Pimoroni Pirate Radio](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/internet-radio-on-your-pirate-radio).

## Usage

Playlists can contain other playlists, so my /home/pi/.config/vlc/playlist.m3u points to the playlist in this repository, i.e. to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memm74/pirate_playlist/master/pirate_playlist.m3u
